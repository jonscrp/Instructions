## Setting up and running different parts of the sensor system 

This is the process of building a consolidated system: start by running each component separately and then integrating them into a stand-alone working system.
The blink example was the first and it demonstrated that the microcontroller is working ok.

![Data Logger]()

This component has two parts:
   1. the RTC or Real-Time Clock that keeps time and date, 
   2. the microSD memory card to read and write permanently.

## To run / test the RTC: 
 
1. In your Arduino IDE Manage Libraries, find and install the RTClib from Adafruit, the latest version.
2. Restart the IDE.

```


3. Go to Examples->RTClib->pcf8523.
4. Make sure the Port and Board are selected correctly.
5. Upload (arrow) and, when 'done Uploading' appears, open the Serial Monitor tool and see what you get.

To speed things up or slow them down change the value in the delay(3000) function in the void loop. These values are milisecs. 
 
The example has the Serial port running at 57600 baud (baud is bits/second). Make sure to change the speed on your Serial Monitor window or modify the program/sketch to 9600baud. (it may not make a difference)

If you want to modify and save this example, SaveAs in your Arduino folder on the Mac: /Users/<username>/Documents/Arduino/. It will make a folder called pcf8523
 
Follow this link for more deets (disregard the picture of a different board!) https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-adalogger-featherwing/adafruit2-rtc-with-arduino
 
Note: pcf8523 is the name/number of the clock chip on the board. 
Note: Baud is a unit of transmission named after the Baudot code used in telegraphy in the 1870s. 1 baud is one bit per second. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudot_code

## To run the microSD card: 
 
1. No need to install a library here. Just go to Examples->SD->Datalogger example. It's part of the general Arduino package.
2. Change the following line...
                            	**const int chipSelect = 4;**
to…
                            	**const int chipSelect = 10;**
  
4. Check that Port and Board are selected correctly...
5. Upload (arrow) and, when 'done Uploading' appears, open the Serial Monitor window and see what you get.
 
You should see a stream of three random numbers because the program/sketch reads the analog inputs A0, A1, and A3 and spits the numbers to the Serial port AND writes these to the microSD card in a file called ______(?). 
Because we don't have any sensors or something connected there these numbers are just noise. **Can you make at least one of these numbers be the battery voltage?.**

Close the **Serial Monitor** and try out the **Serial Plotter** tool to see the stream of numbers plotted. 
 
Let this run for a while then turn off and click out the SD card and read it with the microSD reader dongle. Do you see the file?
 
Again, to slow things down add a **delay()** into the **void loop**

Note: The microSD card needs to be correctly formatted. Your cards have been formatted already but if you notice errors try reformatting. Get the 'official' formatter here https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/eula_mac/index.html

## 2 - ADAFRUIT OLED FEATHERWING display
![Oled Adafruit]()
 
Now let's get the display working. This board (top of the stack) has three buttons that can be programmed to activate different functions. They are: Button A is **#9 (also A7 used for vbatt)**, Button B is **#6**, Button C is **#5**,
 
To run the OLED display card: 
 
1. In your Arduino IDE **Manage Libraries**, find and install the **Adafruit SSD1306**, latest version. Also lookup and install **Adafruit GFX** for programming graphics on the OLED.
 
2. Restart the IDE.
3. Go to **Examples->Adafruit SSD1306->OLED_featherwing**
4. Make sure Port and Board are selected correctly.
5. Upload (arrow).
 
The display should show the Adafruit logo. Then try out the ABC buttons. What happens? (I don't remember). 
 
Note: OLED stands for Organic Light Emitting Diode. This is a newish technology that is low-power, high contrast, and can be made on flexible materials. Check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED .

## 3 - SENSIRION SCD30 CO2 SENSOR
In your Arduino IDE **Manage Libraries**, find and install the **Sparkfun SCD30 Arduino Library**, the latest version.
 
1. Restart the IDE.
2. Go to **Examples->Sparkfun SCD30 Arduino Library->Example1_BasicReadings**
3. Make sure the Port and Board are selected correctly.
4. Upload (arrow).  When 'done Uploading' appears, open the **Serial Monitor** window and see the sensor readings appear about every two secs.
5. Close Monitor. Open Plotter. Now, breathe on the sensor and see the readings spike up into the thousands (ppm).
 
Note: This sensor is known as an NDIR - Non-Dispersive Infrared Sensor. It's an optical technology - you can see the light source blinking on the sensor. It also measures Temperature and Relative Humidity which are used to accurately calculate the CO2 value. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondispersive_infrared_sensor
Note: The SCD30 needs to be recalibrated every so often. I've calibrated your sensors so they should be good for a while. The CO2 measurement also depends on the atmospheric pressure. More on that to follow
 
## 4 - ADAFRUIT BME280 TEMP. PRESS. REL HUMIDITY SENSOR
 
In your Arduino IDE **Manage Libraries**, find and install the **Adafruit BME280 Library**, the latest version.
 
1. Restart the IDE.
2. Go to **Examples->Adafruit BME280 Library->bme280test**
3. Make sure the Port and Board are selected correctly.
4. Upload (arrow).  When 'done Uploading' appears, open the **Serial Monitor** window and see the sensor readings appear about every two secs.
5. Try the Plotter tool too.
 
Note: This sensor (the BME280) is a super popular sensor used in all new cars to keep track of driving conditions. It is very reliable and resistant. 
Note: The pressure reading from this sensor can be passed onto the CO2 SCD30 sensor to improve the accuracy of the readings.
Note: Our sensor unit has two temperature sensors and two humidity sensors; one each on the SCD30 and the BME280
 
## 5- TO BE COMPLETED: WIFI TRANSMITTER
The only missing part of this is to activate and try out the WiFi transmitter which is integrated into the Feather M0 board. I haven't done this yet but if you are feeling adventurous try to do it. The procedure is similar: find the page on the Adafruit website (this one https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-wifi-atwinc1500/using-the-wifi-module) and follow along. LMK how it goes!
