# 1. How to Solder Air Quality Sensor

This is how you solder your air quality sensor parts before assembly.

## Materials:

  +  Terminal Block
  +  CPU and WiFi Board
  +  OLED Display Board
  +  Logger + Clock Board
  +  CO2 Sensor (Sensirion SD30)
  +  Temperature, Pressure, and Relative Humidity Sensor (Adafruit BME 280)
  +  Solder Wire
  +  Wet Sponge
  +  Goggles
  +  Feather Stacking headers(Headers pins)

*** 

## Safety Instructions:
  + Wear goggles
  + Never touch a hot solder iron to yourself or anyone else
  + When not using the solder, place it in a solder holder to avoid fires and burn accidents.

## How To Solder:
## General Steps:

  1. Wait for the soldering iron to heat up.
  2. Moisten the sponge.
  3. Clean up the tip of the iron with the sponge. You can check whether the iron is hot enough by melting a bit of wire on it and cleaning it again.
  4. For each pin: Place the soldering iron making sure it makes contact with the metallic pin(be aware of time, since the board can get overheated!)
  5. Let's start with the extreme pins, just to prevent the stacking header pins from being loose, While keeping the soldering making contact with the pin, take the solder wire and aim the golden part of the pin. The wire should start melting. Keep filling up the golden area with melted solder wire until it looks like a small mountain.
  6. Keep soldering the rest of the pins, you might have to clean the iron between to remove the wire.

## Soldering the components:
  1. Take the OLED screen and header pins. (The shorter sides of the pins should be facing up) Sold each of the pins.
     Note: After soldering, you might need to trim the pins about 1mm, in order to make it fit properly(Refer to pre-assembly tutorial).
  2. Take the **CPU and WiFi Board** and **header pin**. Place the stacking header pins with the black part facing up. Sold each of the pins.
  3. Repeat step 2 for the Data Logger.
