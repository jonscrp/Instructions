In our case, we will be downloading the Windows 11 version.


> If you are using a Mac you will download it as a zip folder.
>  Open the zip folder and copy the Arduino App into your Applications Folder.

## Installing Adafruit Packages and Libraries

Before you can run any programs on the Arduino you will need to install a few packages and libraries. Without these installations, your Arduino will not be able to run any programs.

Copy this
```
 https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json
```
On your Arduino IDE go to 

   1. File >> Preferences
      ![FilePreferences]()

   3. Paste the clipped link into **Additional boards manager URLs**.
      ![Preferences]()
      
   2. Click **Ok**.

## Downloading Arduino Board Library 

  1. Go to Tools >> Board >> Board Manager 

  2. Search SAMD and download **Adafruit SAMD Boards by Adafruit**

## Downloading Other Libraries
  1. Go to Tools >> Manage Libraries
  2.  In the library manager search WiFi 101  and download **WiFi101 by Adafruit**
  3.  Repeat step 2  and download the following libraries
    * Adafruit Sleepy Dog 
    * SparkFun_SCD30_Arduino_Library 
    * Adafruit_GFX
    * Adafruit_SSD1306
    * Adafruit_BME280
    * Adafruit_SH110X
    * Sensirion I2C SEN5X

 At this point, we have to download other libraries not available in the Library Manager
  * [SP30.h by Paul van Haastrecht library](https://github.com/paulvha/sps30.git)
  * [HoneywellTruStabilitySPI.h](https://github.com/huilab/HoneywellTruStabilitySPI.git)
