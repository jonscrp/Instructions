# 3. How to Attach Sensors To Boards
Our current air sensor unit has a CO2 sensor and Temperature, Pressure, and Relative Humidity Sensor, but feel free to add your own combination of sensors to your own unit!

## Materials:
  + CO2 Sensor (Sensirion SD30)
  + Temperature, Pressure, and Relative Humidity Sensor (Adafruit BME280)
  + Header Pins 
  + 2 Connecting Wires with 4 pins each
  + Small Flathead Screwdriver
  + Battery
  + Rubberband (optional)

Before we begin, we suggest soldering your CO2 Sensor (Sensirion SD30) and Temperature, Pressure, and Relative Humidity Sensor (Adafruit BME280). Check out our How to Solder Air Quality Sensor document here!

## Attaching Sensors: 
  1. Place your **CO2 sensor** on the breadboard.
   
  ![CO2 sensor on Breadboard]()

  2. Connect the CO2 pins to the correct connections on the breadboard.

  | Pins |Connection|
  |----|----|
  |VIN | Power|
  |GND |GND|
  |SDA |DATA|
  |SCL | Logger/ Clock|

  > The way you place your CO2 sensor or the other sensors can be different from the way shown here.
  But you need to understand how the [breadboard works](https://youtu.be/fq6U5Y14oM4) and to what     
  connection(Power 3v or 5v, GND, Data, Logger(Clock)) should the sensor pins should connect too. 

 4. Place your **BME sensor** in the breadboard

  6. Connect the BME(Press/Humid/Temp) sensor pins to the correct connections on the breadboard.

  | Pins |Connection|
  |----|----|
  |VIN | Power|
  |GND |GND|
  |SDI |DATA|
  |SCK | Logger/ Clock|
