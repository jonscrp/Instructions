# How to Attach Sensors To Boards
Our current air sensor unit has a CO2 sensor and Temperature, Pressure and Relative Humidity Sensor, but feel free to add your own combination of sensors to your own unit!

## Materials:
  + CO2 Sensor (Sensirion SD30)
  + Temperature, Pressure and Relative Humidity Sensor (Adafruit BME280)
  + Header Pins 
  + 2 Connecting Wires with 4 pins each
  + Small Flathead Screwdriver
  + Battery
  + Rubberband (optional)

Before we begin, we suggest soldering your CO2 Sensor (Sensirion SD30) and Temperature, Pressure, and Relative Humidity Sensor (Adafruit BME280). Check out our How to Solder Air Quality Sensor document here!
