GitHub is an online platform that hosts code. GitHub allows people to collaborate with projects that involve code. You do not need a GitHub account to visit the site or to download code :)

You can find us, The Community Sensor Lab on Github!

One of the first things you will see is the repository folders.

The folder named CSL-AQS-(insert version here) has all the code you need to run your Air Quality Sensor.

The folder images contain all the images in the README.md file. The file README.md contains instructions and additional information about the AQS.

The file wifi_logger_proto.gs contains code that you could use if you want to connect the sensor to a Google Spreadsheet. 

## Download Code

The GREEN button on the right side is the button used to download the entire repository
